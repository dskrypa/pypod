PyPod
=====

Originally forked from `iOSForensics/pymobiledevice <https://github.com/iOSForensics/pymobiledevice>`_.

Due to very heavy modifications, including the deletion of a large amount of code and the addition of new functionality,
it made more sense to create a new repo.


Installation
------------

If installing on Linux, you should run the following first::

    $ sudo apt-get install python3-dev


Regardless of OS, setuptools is required::

    $ pip3 install setuptools


All of the other requirements are handled in setup.py, which will be run when you install like this::

    $ pip3 install git+git://github.com/dskrypa/pypod
